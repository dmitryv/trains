> First of all, I define all distances in the map a positive integer by default.

## There're two kind of questions:

### 1. calculate distance(Question: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Just calculate it step by step and return `NO SUCH ROUTE` when a node is unreachable.

### 2. shortest route(Question: 8, 9) and number of trips(Question: 6, 7, 10)
Both of them are typical search-releated question.
Both BFS and DFS works and I choose BFS.

## Usage

### Run code to solve the problem
```sh
> cd trains
> python3 trains.py
```

### Run UnitTest
```sh
> cd trains
> python3 test.py
```
